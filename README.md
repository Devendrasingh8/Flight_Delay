# Flight_Delay
The file FlightDelays.csv contains information on all commercial flights that departed the Washington, D.C., area and arrived in New York in January 2004. For each flight, there is information on the departure and arrival airports, the distance of the route, the scheduled time and date of the flight, and so on. The variable that we are trying to predict is whether a flight is delayed. A delay is defined as an arrival that is at least 15 minutes later than scheduled.
#This project has three phases: Data Preprocessing, Model Building, Use Testing Data.
#Data Preprocessing consist of Data Reduction, Data Exploration and Data Conversion stage.
#Model Building consist of Naïve Bayes (NB) model, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Logistic Regression model.
#Use Testing Data: Make up five new rows (instances) of data and used them to check accuracy of model.
